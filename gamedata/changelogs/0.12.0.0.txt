0.12.0.0 (2024-11-27)

Changes
- Added the Mill block; an early game 'manual' job where you can craft a variety of things to help you get started
- Added a visual preview for placement of many non-blocky items (jobs and such)
- Change roof blocks to adjust side textures to the block below (instead of static stone bricks / planks respectively)
- Added a dynamic quarter block type that takes the texture of the block it's placed on (can be placed in many orientations as well)
- Added a straw roof option
- Added a planks roof option
- Increased max allowed height for farms like the wheat farm from 3 to 15
- Moved straw production as a side-effect of creating pots of flour to a wheat harvest chance result
- Added an option to invert the Y axis for gamepads
- Alkanet/hollyhock/flax/wolfsbane can now be placed by hand
- Tweaked farmer behaviour a bit to be more likely to complete a max sized field by the end of the day
- Added a detail count video setting; this setting at "very high" is what it previously was; it sets a limit to non-terrain block rendering such as crops when there's a lot of them.

Fixes
- The solid cylinder shape construction area now matches the hollow cylinder shape
- Fix depth/height effect on non-terrain blocks being sort of inversed (only really visible on the textured roof sides in the base game)
- Fix replacement construction jobs getting stuck if their source and target type are the same
- Reduced ambient occlusion intensity on roof blocks (it's quite intense on them, and it helps match the front side in brightness to the walls adjacent to it)
- Fix glider & railcart not sampling lighting correctly, causing them to be too dark in ambiently lit situations
- Reduced cooldown timer on updating steam stats substantially, so achievements trigger more reliable on doing the thing (instead of minutes later)
- Fix consumption/production stats requiring you to open the statistics menu on the appropriate data pages
- Fixed a small issue where some of the larger blocks' colliders would not appear properly until close enough (banner, wisteria plant)
- Fix bed placement tool not telling you when the other end of the bed can't be placed (it just silently blocked you from placing)
- Rotate copper lockbox mesh 180 degrees (it was backwards, sorry)

0.12.0.1 (2024-12-02)

- Fix a minor memory leak
- Attempt to fix a crash issue by adding a couple extra checks
- Various localisation updates

0.12.0.2 (2024-12-02)

- Actually fix the crash issue (thanks Mr.Mug on discord)

0.12.0.3 (2024-12-05)

- Update Norwegian and French locales
- Cleaned up & optimised the mill mesh
- Fix an issue with outside crown moulding corners disappearing when placing inside corners next to it
- Adjusted ambient occlusion strength on beds, non-dynamic quarter blocks, crown moulding
- Fix the Mill berry meal recipe to be 1 bush -> 3 meals, instead of 3 bushes -> 1 meal
- Dynamic quarter blocks can now read the texture from the block they're on when it is not a solid block (only used for mods)
- Fix threat banner being rotated by a few degrees
- Add & tweak colliders for many blocks, and use the new anti-overlap-feature for these
- Fix colored wall-attached flower boxes not actually relying on being wall attached

0.12.0.4 (2024-12-05)

- Set server process priority to Above Normal when running on OSX, hopefully helps with apple's "game mode" not giving the server processing time, resulting in slow moving NPCs and such

0.12.0.5 (2024-12-06)

- Move the workaround from 0.12.0.4 to the server, since it's causing errors. Thanks macOS. Maybe it works now.
