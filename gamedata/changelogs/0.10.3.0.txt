0.10.3.0 (2024-03-14)

Gamepad improvements/changes;
- Hide mouse cursor when using gamepad in UI
- Item tooltips show up when navigating the stockpile menu
- Navigation is d-pad only; removed left-stick menu navigation
- Add some more gamepad keys usable to skip the splash screen
- Add a button to swap selection between the inventory and stockpile, and automatically do so when picking up an item
- Make the stockpile properly remember where the selection was before it closed, and re-use that
- Disabled stockpile scrollbars for gamepad navigation use
- Fix an issue where moving selection left/right in the hotbar with a gamepad could swap selection to the stockpile
- Fix an issue where moving selection from the hotbar to the stockpile would start selecting/scrolling to halfvisible or unvisible stockpile entries
- Made player crafting UI work with gamepad use
- Add left/right shoulder actions to cycle between inventory tabs on gamepads - disable their buttons for gamepad navigation
- Moved inventory trash icon to a more navigable location; added tooltip to explain what it is
- Made science tab of inventory usable with the gamepad
- Added secondary-action (take half stack, drop 1 item, etc) for gamepads in the stockpile UI
- Keep selection focus where it is when using a button in the colony tab (this reloads the page)
- Changed gamepad scrollview scrolling logic
- Changed NPC crafting recipe limit / priority menu to be gamepad compatible
- Improved gamepad handling of sliders
- Made merchant UI work with gamepad

General/misc:
- Narrowed player crafting menu to 1 item wide instead of 3 (there's only 4 player craftable recipes in the base game); Use the space for the stockpile instead
- Fix a potential crash-on-exit for the client due to a missing dependency in cleanup order calculations
- Added automatic UI scaling with resolution on initial load (may also run when updating the game); so 4K doesn't load with an absolutely tiny UI
- Fix a bug in UI Scale not being appropriately lowered when reducing resolution (resulting in higher scales than allowed for the resolution)
- Increasing resolution now also increases UI scale (to also prevent really tiny UI when you go from 1080p to 4K & such)
- Moved the UI Scale setting from gameplay settings to video setting
- Reduced default torch quality from "Max" to "High"
- Don't show 0 seconds recipe cooldowns in tooltips (merchant recipe tooltips in science unlocks)
- Fix tooltips not respecting screen edges correctly when using UI scaling
- Doors now also work outside of active colonies
- Fishermen can now fish in water 1 or 2 blocks lower than them
- Lengthened the fishing rod by a bit now that water is transparent (and they can fish from higher)
- Allow use of the buy/sell 5/25 buttons in the merchant UI when conditions only allow less than 5/25; just buy/sell till 0 / point cap
- Swapped unavailable & completed order in the science UI (navigating to/from completed when interacting with gamepads was annoying)

0.10.3.1 (2024-03-18)

- Change to priority options of crafting limits UI to make it more visible (regression fix)
- Improved the .ply mesh importer to support alternative ordering of vertex color and UV data (so blender 4.x exports work out of the box)
- Replaced night ambient audio loop
- Fix science tab sliders being effectively invisible till selected
- Stop showing tooltips when the application is not focused

0.10.3.2 (2024-03-26)

- Replaced day ambient audio loop (copyright related)
- Replaced several mentions of clicking and key bindings etc in the text with the actual active key bindings (gamepad aware)
- Improved gamepad selection navigation flow for the science tab - should be more intuitive to get to the "Complete" button
- Improved logic for selecting the next navigable element when navigation the UI with a dpad
- Swapped out the sprite set for keys

- Disabled a few scrollbars in various places when using gamepad navigation
